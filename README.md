*Project Overview*:

Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 pixel images across 10 categories, including airplanes, cars, and animals. The project aimed to achieve high accuracy while preventing overfitting through data augmentation and regularization techniques.

*Key Features*:

- Implemented a CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras libraries to extract hierarchical features from images.
- Applied *data augmentation* techniques such as random flipping, zooming, and rotation to improve generalization.
- Utilized dropout layers and batch normalization to prevent overfitting and speed up convergence.
- Achieved over 74% accuracy on the CIFAR-10 test dataset by training on augmented data.
- Evaluated the model’s performance by visualizing correct and incorrect predictions.

*Technologies Used*:
- *Python*: Programming language for implementation.
- *TensorFlow* and *Keras*: Deep learning frameworks for building and training the CNN.
- *Matplotlib*: Used to visualize training history and model predictions.
- *Sklearn*: For splitting the dataset into training and validation sets.

*Results*:

Successfully achieved an accuracy of over 74% on the test data. The model’s robustness was further evaluated by inspecting true and false predictions, revealing insights into where the model performed well and where improvements could be made.
